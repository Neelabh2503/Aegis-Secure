**Q — Can you tell me if you have ever received suspicious SMS or emails (like scams, OTP fraud, lottery wins, etc.)? How did you deal with them?**

**Answer:**  
Not personally, but her friends have received suspicious SMS. She mentioned the government helpline number 1930, which helps with bank transactions that might be part of a scam, and there is also a cybercrime portal. If any changes are made to a bank PIN or phone number, we can directly email the bank and their fraud detection team will investigate further.

**Q — Do you feel confident recognizing scams on your own? Or is it confusing sometimes?**

**Answer:**  
It can be confusing. As cybersecurity evolves, hackers get smarter. An article recently mentioned they sometimes use Cyrillic characters that look like Latin letters, so text can appear normal while actually using different characters — which makes detection harder.

**Q — If you had an app that could scan messages for scams, what would make you actually use it regularly?**

**Answer:**  
She would use it if she has many contacts, including strangers, because that increases the chance of receiving suspicious messages.

---

**Q — Would you prefer the app to work automatically in the background, or would you rather paste suspicious messages yourself when needed? Why?**

 **Answer:**  
If the app runs in the background, battery usage could increase and the system might slow down. As a student, she wouldn’t use or need such an app frequently, so she prefers pasting messages manually.

---

**Q — What kind of explanation would help you trust the app’s results? (e.g., short plain-language reasons, a score, or just “scam/safe”)**

**Answer:**  
Short, plain-language explanations would be very useful if provided by the app.

---

**Q — How comfortable are you with giving an app permission to read your SMS/email? What conditions would make you feel safe granting this?**

**Answer:**  
She would be concerned about data privacy, but she would feel comfortable granting permission if the app can guarantee full confidentiality.

---

**Q — If the app makes a mistake (flags safe as scam or misses a scam), what would you expect to do? Would you want to correct it somehow?**

**Answer:**  
If we are using AI/LLM, the model needs training. Feedback from someone knowledgeable can provide correct labels, and that feedback can be used to retrain the model.

---

**Q — How important is it for you that the app works in your preferred language? Would English-only be okay, or do you need other languages?**

**Answer:**  
Training the model in multiple languages and providing explanations in those languages would be helpful. People who are not comfortable in English would benefit from explanations in their mother tongue.

---

**Q — When using apps, what frustrates you most (e.g., complicated steps, too much tech jargon, too many notifications)?**

**Answer:**  
Many people are afraid of scams, so they likely won’t be frustrated even if they have to input messages manually.

---

**Q — Would you like to see a history or summary of past scans, or is a one-time result enough for you?**

**Answer:**  
A history or summary is fine as a reminder, although it might not be used daily.

---

**Q — What would make you trust or not trust this app?**

**Answer:**  
Trust could be built if the app guarantees user privacy/confidentiality and if the model is accurate enough.

---

**Q — If you could request one must-have feature, what would it be?**

**Answer:**  
Everything planned is fine, but colour coding (e.g., red for scam, green for safe) would be a useful addition.
